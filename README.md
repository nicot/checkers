checkers
========
This game checkers we made for the CSCI 2270 final project.
Currently working on a graphical front end and AI
To play the game run the script in python. You select a piece with an
array index between 0 and 63, and a position to move it to using the same
method. It is automatically set up to play between a computer and
player, but this can be changed by setting the players variable to 2.
Good luck!
